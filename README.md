Wes Anderson Trivia Game...

Because why not?

It's a little touchy yet, but the user has 100 seconds to answer 6 questions about the iconic films of Wes Anderson. It's hard. 

Each time a user chooses an answer, they are shown wether they were right or wrong for 3 seconds and their result is tracked, before they are allowed onto the next trivia question. 

Once they make it through all of the questions, their total right decides if they win or lose. They have the option to reset the game with a button.
